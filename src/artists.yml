  content: <p>Cartoonist and animator David Blumenstein has spent the last year producing a weekly webcomic called <em>Showman? The Bret Braddock Adventures</em>, a comic tragedy about a very ignorant man running a very bad animation company. The company it’s based on hoped to create an animated series about their wacky office. David is now developing his strip as an animated series. So that series will be based on a comic which is about a company which wanted a series made about themselves. But this won’t be that series. I’m confused.</p>

  name: Michael Hawkins
  slug: michael-hawkins
  first_name: Michael
  content: Michael Hawkins completed his BFA at Tas Uni in 2001 before toiling in relative obscurity editing an annual comics anthology and curating the accompanying launch exhibition. He has since (2006) relocated to Melbourne where he’s insinuated his paintings/drawings into numerous group shows and two solo shows. He has taken time in particular to associate with the local comics artists, has contributed to comix anthologies and self-published his own small press comics, culminating in his new <em>Frosnall Graaf</em> series, inclusion in the Inherent Vice residency at the National Gallery of Victoria Studio and contribution to the new Dailies newspaper anthology. He has attempted at length to produce a novel length graphic narrative but has thus far discarded the results, though not the ambition. He also has a range of tie-dye t-shirts.
