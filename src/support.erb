		<h2>How do I get aboard the Caravan?</h2>
	  <p>There are <em>all sorts</em> of different ways to get on board - the most important thing is come say hi if you can! Check out the <a href="/about.html">details page</a> and see where we're going to be and when. We're coming all this way to meet you, you know?</p>
	  <p>You can also follow us on <a href="http://facebook.com/caravanofcomics" title="Caravan of comics on Facebook">Facebook<a/> and <a href="http://twitter.com/caravanofcomics" title="Follow Caravan of Comics on Twitter" >Twitter</a> - and tell two friends to do the same. And tell them to tell two of their friends. And so on.</p>
	  <p>Pretty soon we'll be launching something of a fundraiser to help offset some of the ludicrous costs associated with getting a dozen people to the other side of the world for three weeks, so keep an eye out for that, okay?
	  </p><p><strong>In the meantime</strong>, you can order some fine comics from these caravaners, you know?</p>
